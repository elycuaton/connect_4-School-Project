## About the Project

Connect 4 is a classic two-player connection board game, where players take turns dropping discs into a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of one's own color.

This implementation provides an easy-to-use console-based user interface and follows best practices in OOP design.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by running the compiled executable or building and running the project in your preferred C# development environment.
2. The game will display the current state of the Connect 4 board and prompt Player 1 to make a move.
3. To choose a column for dropping your disc, enter a number between 1 and 7 (inclusive) and press Enter.
   - The columns are numbered from left to right, starting with 1.
   - Make sure the chosen column is not full; otherwise, you will need to choose another column.
4. The game will then prompt Player 2 to make their move, and the process repeats.
5. The game continues until one player connects four discs in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
